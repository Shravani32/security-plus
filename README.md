## What I Learned

- I listened to all of James Messer's videos, most of Jason Dion's course on Udemy (get it cheap by opening a private browser tab), and some of Mike Meyers' videos.
- Videos by Mike Meyers were helpful when I needed a break from Messer's and Dion's. Messer was most straightforward to the exam objectives. Meyers the least.
- Where the videos were not helpful in unpacking the exam objectives, I fell back on the book, [_CompTIA Security+ All-in-One Exam Guide, Fifth Edition (Exam SY0-501)_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07893H98L)
- Know your basic [ports](https://github.com/aaronshaf/security-plus/blob/master/ports.md). This was important for the lab questions.
- The [CompTIA Security+ Test](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.abc.comptiasecurityplus&hl=en_US) app for Android was phenomenal. Get it.
- If you're a WGU student: uCertify material was comparatively not helpful.
- Kaplan practice tests seemed to cover a lot of material that categorically wasn't on the exam.
- Jason Dion's practice exams on Udemy were helpful.
- Don't disproportionately stress about the "6. Cryptography and PKI" section -- study broadly across all sections.
