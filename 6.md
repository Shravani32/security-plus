([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nb51aDeBcF0&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=117), [Jason Dion 1](https://www.udemy.com/program/comptia-security/learn/2015076/lecture/13219750#overview), [Jason Dion 2](https://www.udemy.com/program/comptia-security/learn/2015076/lecture/13219754#overview), [Mike Meyers 1](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9826554#overview), [Mike Meyers 2](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9826578#questions), [Mike Meyers 3](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9826696#overview))

- Cryptographic terms
  - Ciphertext - an encrypted msg
  - Cipher - The algorithm used to encrypt / decrypt
  - Keys 
    - Add the key / keys to the cypher to encrypt
    - Larger keys are generally more secure 
    - Some encryption methods use more than one key,every method is bit different 
  - When a sender wants to transmit a private message to a recipient, the sender takes the plain text (unencrypted) message and encrypts it using an algorithm and a key. This produces a cipher text message that is transmitted to the recipient. The recipient then uses a similar algorithm and key to decrypt the cipher text and re-create the original plain text message for viewing.(Stewart


### 6.1.1 Symmetric algorithms
 ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pArLLJmgX10&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=118), [Jason Dion](https://www.udemy.com/program/comptia-security/learn/2015076/lecture/13219756#overview), [Mike Chapple](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/comptia-security-plus-sy0-501-cert-prep-6-cryptography/symmetric-and-asymmetric-cryptography?autoSkip=true&contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3A57bdd64992015ae4c0cb990e&resume=false&u=2045532))
  - Single, shared key. Encrypt and decrypt with same key.
  - "Doesn't scale very well. Can be challenging to distribute." (Messer)
  - Use shared key algorithm / shared shared secret
  - Fast
  - The common symmetric solutions 
    -  Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), 
    -  Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES), 
    -  Data Encryption Standard (DES), 
    -  Blowfish / Twofish, 
    -  Rivest Cipher 4 (RC4)
### 6.1.2 Modes of operation
  - Most symmetric algorithms are block ciphers or offer a block cipher function. 
  - There are many methods by which the plain text blocks are encrypted into cipher text blocks. (Stewart)
  - Most symmetric algorithms support several modes of operations, including ECB, CBC, CTM, and GCM.
  - Detailed on [Block Cipher Modes section](#622-block-cipher-modes)
### 6.1.3 Asymmetric algorithms 
([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pArLLJmgX10&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=118), [Jason Dion](https://www.udemy.com/program/comptia-security/learn/2015076/lecture/13219762#overview))
  - AKA "Public key cryptography" - two or more mathematically related keys 
  - Private key - keep this private
  - Public key - give it away 
  - Only private key can decrypt the data thats encrypted with public key
  - The most widely used asymmetric cryptography solutions are as follows:
    - Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (RSA)
    - Diffie-Hellman
    - DSA
    - PGP/GPG
    - Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)‚Äù
  - Key generation
    - This process will build both private and public keys at the same time 
    - Start with a large random number - large prime number 
    - key generation programme then create 2 keys
  - Symmetric keys from asymmetric keys
    - A-priv + B-pub and B-priv+ A-pub 
    - This will create a symmetric key that is identical 
### 6.1.4 Hashing 
([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdEhSPoDaY&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=119), [Jason Dion](https://www.udemy.com/program/comptia-security/learn/2015076/lecture/13309744#overview), [Mike Chapple](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/comptia-security-plus-sy0-501-cert-prep-6-cryptography/hash-functions?contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3A57bdd64992015ae4c0cb990e&resume=false&u=2045532))
  - Hash AKA "message digest" 
    - "Impossible to recover the original message from the digest. Used to store passwords / confidentiality." (Messer)
    - Intent: Two messages won't have same hash, otherwise there is a collision.
    - Use to store passwords (we can compare passwords without knowing the actual value) - confidentiality
    - Integrity - to verify the downloaded document is the same as the original
    - Hashing can be attacked using reverse engineering, reverse hash matching, or a birthday attack. These attack methods are commonly used by password-cracking tools.(Stewart)
    - [Hashing algorithms](#624-hashing-algorithms)

### 6.1.5 Salt, IV, nonce
  - Nonce
    - A number used once, arbitrarily chosen
    - Could be counter
    - When used as salt, prevents replays
  - IV: Initialization vector - type of nonce, used for randomizing an encryption scheme (WEP/older SSL)
  - Salt: nonce used to randomize hashes
    - A salt is secret data added to input material prior to the hashing process. 
    - Salting hashes makes the process of attaching them much more complicated and computationally intensive. (Stewart)
### 6.1.6 Elliptic curve cryptography ECC
 ([Mike Chapple](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/comptia-security-plus-sy0-501-cert-prep-6-cryptography/elliptic-curve-and-quantum-cryptography?contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3A57bdd64992015ae4c0cb990e&resume=false&u=2045532))
  - Asymmetric encryption ues large integers - lots of resources needed 
  - ECC use curves instead of large prime numbers
  - ECC Uses smaller keys than non-ECC asymmetric encryption. 
  - Smaller storage and transmission requirement. Perfect for mobile devices." (Messer)
### 6.1.7 Weak/deprecated algorithms
 ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZ8bWG2G_s&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=121))
  - "Strong algorithms have been around for a while." (Messer)
  - Weak: WEP, DES (56-bit keys)
  - Strong: PGP, AES
### 6.1.8 Key exchange
 ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5c_Yed71tvU&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=122))
  - Out-of-band key exchange. Not over the 'net. Not practical.
  - Common to do in-band key exchange with additional encryption. "Use asymmetric encryption to deliver a symmetric key." (Messer)
### 6.1.9 Digital signatures
  - Sign with private key, verify with public key
  - Useful for proving integrity of message and for authenticating the source
  - Non-repudiation
  - Signing and verifying digital signature
    - A hash plaintext with hasing algorithm and sign with private key
    - this will become the digital signature
    - B then receive this and decrypt the digital signature with A's public key
    - this will give the hash of the plaintext
    - B then use the exact same hashing algo with the plain text to compare the result with original hash
### 6.1.10 Diffusion
 ([Mike Chapple](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/comptia-security-plus-sy0-501-cert-prep-6-cryptography/cryptographic-math?contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3A57bdd64992015ae4c0cb990e&resume=false&u=2045532))
  - Change on character of the input, and many characters change of the output.
  - This make it harder to guess from the input 
  - Confusion and diffusion are important concepts of crypto, you need both
### 6.1.11 Confusion
  - Data that encrypted are Drastically different from plaintext.
  - The process should be non-linear - No discernible patterns.
  - 
### 6.1.12 Collision
  - When two inputs create the same hash.
### 6.1.13 Obfuscation
  - "Process of making something unclear." (Messer)
  - Difficult but not impossible to understand
### 6.1.14 Steganography
 ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxH2IyEq2O8&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=123), [Mike Meyers](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-certification-sy0-501-the-total-course/learn/lecture/9826654#overview))
  - Form of obfuscation
  - Images: Hiding, embedding information in picture
  - Network: Embed messages in TCP packets
  - Printers: Watermarks. Yellow dots.
### 6.1.15 Stream vs. block
 ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7J2XbZNNF4A&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=124))
  - Stream ciphers:
    - If we are streaming information across the network in real time, encryption is done One bit or byte at a time. High speed, low hardware complexity." (Messer)
    - "Used with symmetric encryption. (Not used in asymmetric encryption because of the overhead)" (Messer)
    - Since we are sending similar information frequently, Key is often combined with an initialization vector to make them look different
  - Block ciphers:
    - "Fixed-length groups. Often 64-bit or 128-bit blocks." (Messer)
    - "Pad added to short blocks. Each block is encrypted or decrypted independently." (Messer)
    - Use symmetric encryption 
    - mode of operation depends on requirement
### 6.1.16 Key strength 
([Jason Dion](https://www.udemy.com/program/comptia-security/learn/2015076/lecture/13219766#overview))
  - "Large keys tend to be more secure." (Messer)
  - "128-bit or larger symmetric keys are common." (Messer)
  - Asymmetric encryption: "Complex calculations of prime numbers. Larger keys than symmetric encryption. Common to see key lengths of 3,072 bits or larger." (Messer)
### 6.1.17 Session keys
  - "A session key is a symmetric key used for encrypting messages during a communication session. It is generated from random seeds and is used for the duration of a communication session." (Conklin)
### 6.1.18 Ephemeral key
  - "Implement session keys carefully. Need to change often. these temporary keys are called ephemeral keys
  - Need to be unpredictable." (Messer)
  - Not incremented by one, etc.
### 6.1.19 Secret algorithm
  - "Secrecy in how to apply secu- rity elements can assist in thwarting reverse engineering." (Conklin)
  - "The drawback of keeping a cryptographic algorithm secret is that it reduces the test- ing of the algorithm by cryptographers." (Conklin)
- States of data ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgfEZDYR_gc&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=125))
### 6.1.20 Data-in-transit
  - "Transmitted over the network." (Messer)
  - Transport encryption: TLS (Transport Layer Security). IPSec (Internet Protocol Security).
### 6.1.21 Data-at-rest
  - On storage device.
  - Options: Whole disk encryption. Database encryption. File- or folder-level encryption. (Messer)
  - Apply ACL - only authorized users can access 
### 6.1.22 Data-in-use
  - "System RAM, CPU registers and cache." (Messer)
  - "Almost always decrypted." (Messer)
  ### 6.1.23 Random/pseudo-random number generation 
  ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrpgL2D6JxU&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=120))
  - "True random numbers are virtually impossible to generate from physical or algorithmic processes because of the influences associated with the underlying process. This leads to the field of pseudo-random numbers, a set of numbers that while statistically appearing to be random with respect to frequency distribution, because they are algorithmically generated, if one knows the algorithm and the seeds, one can predict future values." (Conklin)
### 6.1.24 Key stretching
 ([Mike Chapple](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/comptia-security-plus-sy0-501-cert-prep-6-cryptography/key-stretching?contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3A57bdd64992015ae4c0cb990e&resume=false&u=2045532))
  - i.e. "key strengthening"
  - Two techniques, salting and hashing 
  - Salting adds a value to the enc key to make it more complex
  - Hashing adds time to the verification process by requiring more math
  - verifying one key is fast (for the user) but guessing millions of keys is slow (for attacker)
  - Two algos , PBKDF2 and bcrypt
  - "Hash a password. Hash the hash of the password." (Messer)
  - Multiplies time required to brute force
  
### 6.1.25 Implementation vs. algorithm selection
  - Crypto service provider
  - Crypto modules
### 6.1.26 Perfect forward secrecy PFS
([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZxPBen7QZw&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=126))
  - Traditionally SSL/TLS used a private keys stored on webserver to encrypt the data, this is risky.
  - One way to avoid this single point of failure is to use PFS
  - Doesn't use server's private RSA key.
  - Creates keys on the fly. Temporary.
  - "Might use elliptic curve or Diffie-Hellman ephemeral." - session keys are not kept around
  - Uses more computing power.
  - browser must support PFS
### 6.1.27 Security through obscurity
  - Design not necessarily secret
  - Encryption key the only unknown
### 6.1.28 Common use cases
 ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yleZJB46Dg&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=127))
  - Low power devices
    - Mobile. Portable. Smaller symmetric key sizes. Use elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) for asymmetric encryption.
  - Low latency
    - Fast. Symmetric encryption. Smaller key sizes.
  - High resiliency
    - Larger key sizes. Hashing provides integrity.

    - Add salts to randomize the stored hash
  - Supporting non-repudiation
    - Confirm the authenticity of data
    - Digital signature provides both integrity and non-repudiation
    - "You said it. You can't deny it."
  - Resource vs. security constraints
    - An ongoing battle
    - Browser support vs. supporte encryption
    - VPN software support vs. supported algorithms

### 6.2.2 Block Cipher Modes
 ([James Messer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rE-KlhBlq4&list=PL5ysgoFoCpZEM8cboeHdRDePc2bOU9CN1&index=129), [Mike Chapple](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/comptia-security-plus-sy0-501-cert-prep-6-cryptography/cipher-modes?autoSkip=true&contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3A57bdd64992015ae4c0cb990e&resume=false&u=2045532))

  - Stream vs. block

    - we take single piece of a information and cut it in to single size blocks
    - Block size is a fixed size
    - Then we perform encryption on a single block at a time
    - Block cipher Mode of operation - how encryption happens on blocks
      - Defines the method of encryption
      - May provide a method of authentication 
      - if mode of operation require a certain block size and your data not fit in , it will get patted 
  - ECB: Electronic Codebook
    - Not commonly used -so simple 
    - Each block encrypted with same key
    - If our plaintext blocks are identical and we use the same key it will be too easy to fig out
  - CBC: Cipher Block Chainings
    - Adds randomization to the process
    - Each plaintext block is XORed with previous ciphertext block
      - Adds additional randomization
      - Uses an initialization vector for the first block since it doesn't get XORed with previous ciphertext
      - from the second block it will be XORed with previous ciphertext
  
  - CTR: Counter
    - Counter Mode is similar to CBC in that an additional value is added or incorporated into each block prior to encryption
    - The difference is that CTR does not use a random number and does not chain the blocks. 
    - Instead, it uses an independent counter, which both the sender and receiver have access to. 
    - Each block uses a counter value as the IV, and then the counter is incremented for the next block. 
    - Considered strong only for ciphers using block size >128 bits (Stewart) 
    - Block cipher mode / acts like stream cipher
      - Encrypts successive values of a "counter"
  - GCM: Galois/Counter Mode
    - Galois Counter Mode is an advancement over CTR that adds a hashing function to confirm the integrity of deciphered data. 
    - However, while GCM uses hashing to check integrity, it is described as an authentication code. 
    - GCM, like CTR, requires blocks of at least 128 bits. 
    - GCM is widely used in TLS cipher suites with AES (Stewart)
    - Minimum latency, minimum operation overhead
      - Very efficient encryption and authentication
    - Commonly used in packetized data
      - Network traffic security (wireless, IPsec)
      - SSH TLS

    -  The message was not altered after being signed - Integrity
    -  The recipient can prove these facts to a third party - non-repudiation
  - What digital signatures depend on
    - Collision resistant hash functions  (no two inputs produce same output)
    - Asymmetric cryptography (anything encrypted with one key pair only can decrypted with same key pair)
    - Use private key for encryption and public key for decryption (reverse from other uses like sending secret msg, this verify only the person with private key signed it)
